[zigpy-deconz](https://github.com/zigpy/zigpy-deconz) is a Python 3 radio libary implementation for the [Zigpy](https://github.com/zigpy/) project to implement [deCONZ](https://www.dresden-elektronik.de/funktechnik/products/software/pc/deconz/) based [Zigbee](https://www.zigbee.org) radio devices.

The goal of this project to add native support for the Dresden-Elektronik deCONZ based ZigBee modules in Home Assistant via [Zigpy](https://github.com/zigpy/).

This library uses the deCONZ serial protocol for communicating with [ConBee](https://www.dresden-elektronik.de/conbee/), [ConBee II (ConBee 2)](https://shop.dresden-elektronik.de/conbee-2.html), and [RaspBee](https://www.dresden-elektronik.de/raspbee/) adapters from [Dresden-Elektronik](https://github.com/dresden-elektronik/).

# Hardware requirements

dresden elektronik based radios USB-adapters and GPIO-modules with deCONZ Serial Protocol compatible with zigpy-deconz:

- [ConBee II (a.k.a. ConBee 2)](https://shop.dresden-elektronik.de/conbee-2.html) USB adapter
- [RaspBee II (a.k.a. RaspBee 2)](https://www.dresden-elektronik.com/product/raspbee-II.html) GPIO radio module
- [ConBee](https://www.dresden-elektronik.de/conbee/) USB radio adapter
- [RaspBee](https://www.dresden-elektronik.de/raspbee/) GPIO radio module

# Testing new releases

Testing a new release of the zigpy-deconz library before it is released in Home Assistant.

If you are using Supervised Home Assistant (formerly known as the Hassio/Hass.io distro):
- Add https://github.com/home-assistant/hassio-addons-development as "add-on" repository
- Install "Custom deps deployment" addon
- Update config like: 
  ```
  pypi:
    - zigpy-deconz==0.9.0
  apk: []
  ```
  where 0.5.1 is the new version
- Start the addon

If you are instead using some custom python installation of Home Assistant then do this:
- Activate your python virtual env
- Update package with ``pip``
  ```
  pip install zigpy-deconz==0.9.0
